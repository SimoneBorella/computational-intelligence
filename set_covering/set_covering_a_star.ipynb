    "# A* algoritm for set covering problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the solution of the set covering problem.\n",
    "The A* is searching algorithm which aims to find the shortest path between an initial and a final state.\n",
    "This algorithm is based on the estimation of the total cost from the initial to the final state for each state reached.\n",
    "So for each state are computed a cost function, which represent the cost to reach that state by the initial state, and the heuristic function which estimates in an optimistical way the cost to reach the final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function is the amount of sets select up until the current state, because of the unit cost of each set.\n",
    "Here I proposed two heuristics:\n",
    "- heuristic1(state) estimate the cost by computing the number of uncovered elements of the current set and the ordered list of the number of covered elements of the not taken sets which are in the same position of uncovered elements in the current set and returning as a result the number of sets which sum of the dimensions of covered elements is higher than the uncovered size of the current set.\n",
    "- heuristic2(state) estimate the cost by computing the list of the not taken sets ordered by the number of covered elements which are in the same position of uncovered elements in the current set and trying to fill the current set with the first set of the ordered list.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  So the current set is updated with the covered elements of the taken set and then the list of not taken sets is recomputed and so on, until the actual set is entirely covered and so the number of the added sets is the heuristic result."
